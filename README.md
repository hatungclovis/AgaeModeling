# AlgaeModeling
# We are given the weights of the algae population for the first few months.
# We are tasked with predicting future values of the weight by regression.
# Here, we use Numpy, Mathplotlib libraries to write a Tailor polynomial
# that we use to predict by regression future values of the weight of the algae population
